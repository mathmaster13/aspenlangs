# [aspenlangs](https://aspenlangs.neocities.org/)
A package for code related to mochaspen's conlangs.

This repo does ***not*** include any code related to Fynotek, which is mochaspen's most developed conlang.
Due to its significance, it has its own separate package (specifically for the JVM) at [fynotek-java](https://github.com/mathmaster13/fynotek-java/).
