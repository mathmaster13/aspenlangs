 * Returns `true` if a word is orthographically and phonotactically valid as specified by `validator`, and `false` otherwise.
 * Multiple words can be separated by whitespace, and this method will only return `true` if all words in `sequence` are valid.
 * Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored (the [String.trim] method is called on `sequence`).
 * A sequence containing punctuation marks or other characters that are not part of words returns `false`,
 * as well as an empty sequence or one containing only whitespace.
